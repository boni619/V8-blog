BlinkOn is a biannual meeting of Blink, V8, and Chromium contributors. BlinkOn 6 was held in Munich on June 16 and June 17. The V8 team gave a number of presentations on architecture, design, performance initiatives, and language implementation.

The V8 BlinkOn talks are embedded below.

*   [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14WZkWbkvtmZDEIBYP5H1GrbC9H-W3nJSg3nvpHwfG5U/edit)

Outlines the history of how V8 measures JavaScript performance, the different eras of benchmarking, and a new technique to measure page loads across real-world, popular websites with detailed breakdowns of time per V8 component.
